A student of mine was introducing herself to regular expressions via the (very interesting) [Regex Crossword](https://regexcrossword.com) game. I made an offhand comment about how it would be really easy to brute force such puzzles, because the tree complexity is lower than it first appears. About fourteen hours of banging my head against an increasingly complicated solver later, I finally both actually understood the nature of the regex crossword puzzles and had successfully arrived at an algorithm to solve it efficiently. I then reimplemented that final, optimized algorithm while my student watched in abject awe, and this is that code. This description of events is entirely accurate. (Quoth my student: "Sure.")

Don't use this to pretend to be better at Regex Crossword than you are. That's not cool.
